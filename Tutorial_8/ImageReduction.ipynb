    "# Image Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Astropy I tutorial, we looked at an image of Messier 3. We hope you found it pretty, but when it comes to getting science out of it, pretty is not enough. For most astronomical sources, the only means of getting information about them is electromagnetic waves, popularly known as light. Hence, it becomes necessary to have precise measurement of light coming from our source of interest. This measurement is known as [photometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)) and is pivotal for getting meaningful results out of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a raw CCD image is far from fit to be used for science. Let us see why.\n",

    "## CCD Cameras in Astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "[CCD cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device#Use_in_astronomy) have been a huge upgrade over the traditional use of [photographic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate#Astronomy) for astronomical imaging. This is primarily due to their high quantum efficiency (an efficiency of 100% implies one count for each incident photon) and linearity in output. In other words, if the quantum efficiency is 80% and 100 photons are incident on a CCD pixel, the output will show around 80 counts. Linearity implies that the same pixel will show close to 160 counts if 200 photons were incident. These two properties combined with a bunch of other convenient properties have established CCD cameras as the primary detectors for telescopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So how do they work?\n",
    "\n",
    "(CCDs by themselves can be a standalone topic to study. However, we shall look at them from a simplistic point of view in this tutorial.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A CCD camera chip is basically a grid of pixels (4108x4096 in our case), each pixel being a tiny capacitor. The camera shutter is initially closed and these capacitors are maintained at a certain voltage, known as the **Bias Voltage**. As soon as we open the shutter, photons are incident on the surface of our camera. Each pixel acts as a \"photon bucket\" and counts the number of incident photons in the form of electrons (thanks to the [Photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect)). Once our exposure is finished, the shutter is closed and the charge stored in the form of electrons in each pixel is \"read out\". This is how we get our image in the form of a FITS file, which we explored a bit in the Astropy tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since a CCD is an electronic device, it is impossible to escape noise and errors. Consequently, it becomes important to get rid of as many errors as possible before declaring the image fit to be used for science. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of converting a raw image into a \"useful\" image is known as **Image Reduction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, **you are encouraged** to go through [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=2ahUKEwif1qPA3oPpAhWn7nMBHfRBDhMQFjABegQIDBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aavso.org%2Ffiles%2Fimage_calibration-v1.pdf&usg=AOvVaw38WCFirYcCzT9rcH-udbiQ) document that will introduce you to Bias, Flat and Dark frames, and why each of them is crucial to Image Reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images we're using were taken using the [GROWTH-India Telescope](https://sites.google.com/view/growthindia/) for which the CCD ambient temperature is -60<sup>o</sup>C. The dark current at such low temperatures is negligible, and hence only the Flat and Bias frames are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the data for this tutorial from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NAvPOt4jQU-oQq4s0fD6JqqiBfwxex59) and extract the contents at the location of this notebook.

This is not a time dependent phenomnea, and in practice it is taken with a very small exposure. \n",
