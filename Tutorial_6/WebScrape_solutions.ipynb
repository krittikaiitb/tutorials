Sometimes, it's easy to directly download these datasets from some websites. But some annoying websites do not make it that easy for you! For instance, in the first tutorial, the Moons_and_planets.csv file was parsed from this Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_satellites where there is no option to directly download the dataset :(\n",

    "The function get_map() returns a numpy array of name of the stars in that particular constellation, the formatted RA, Dec coordinates for each star in hours and degrees respectively and the [apparent magnitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude). You might have noticed the use of `try` and `except` in the above code. These commands are used to handle errors while executing. The interpreter will first try to execute the code inside `try`. If an error gets thrown up during that execution(for instance, incorrect formatting), the code inside `except` will get executed. This makes sure that any star with any formatting errors in its data will be skipped. A more accurate function which does not skip such stars will be given in the solutions of this tutorial for anyone who wants a better method.<br>\n",
    "The lxml parser has been used in the above function. Different parsers give different results and you should always use the parser that works for you. lxml is one of the fastest parsers available.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next step, you will need to write a function that takes in the celestial coordinates(RA, Dec) and returns its projections into a Cartesian space. This is called a **[Stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection)**, where points on a sphere are projected on to a plane. A hint to approach this would be to first convert RA, Dec to spherical coordinates on a unit sphere and then apply stereographic projection formulae. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot the final figure, write a function plot() that takes in a constellation name and plots it. The size of the star must be proportional to its brightness or flux. In tutorial 2, there was a discussion on Magnitudes in Astronomy and its relation to flux, which might prove useful here. Do normalize the size values before using them. If the points come out too small, you can scale the size appropriately."
