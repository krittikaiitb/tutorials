    "# Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now, we have seen quite a few functions (especially in [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/krittikaiitb/tutorials/tree/master/Tutorial_02)). The question arises then on what exactly a fuction is and if we can define functions of our own. This tutorial will use what we have learnt of Python and Numpy and help us take it a step further with user defined functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is simply a piece of code that performs a task, for which it might take some input(s) and might return some output(s) (This will of course depend on the task). The input (and the output) could be a number, an array, a string etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need such a thing? If there is a function to evaluate a polynomial at a given point, then we can just code it normally. The answer is robustness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from just being correct, codes should ideally be robust, efficient, easy to debug, and of course, self explanatory for someone else reading it. Functions are very important for acheiving all of the above, with utmost simplicity. Functions are also very useful if you want the same task to be performed repeatedly, with no changes, or maybe with minor modifications. For example, if you want to evaluate that polynomial repeatedly, then it is better to define a function to do so, otherwise simple typing mistakes in one of those lines might break your code. Or if you want to now change your polynomial coefficients, and you have 100 repetitions of the code, then you'll have to go line by line to each of those. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In short, functions eventually make your code easier to read and modify, and much easier to debug.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following references should be useful:\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions and https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/language/functions.html for exhaustive description on functions.\n",
    "And of course, Google."

    "2. Part 2 (this notebook)deals with the nuances of function definition, and can be thought of as a supplement to the main notebook. There may be issues that are discussed here which you might face in the future. So do take out some time to read through this part, just enough to recognise and understand the error messages and how you could proceed in debugging. \n"
